I chose to recreate a product card for a **Skyride BMV X6 Foldable Cruiser Bicycle | 26-Inch White Bike with 21-Speed Gears, Dual Disc Brakes, Hydraulic Suspension, and Strong Carbon Steel Frame | Great for City Rides and Off-Road Adventures** from Amazon. The design mimics Amazon's card layout as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS.
